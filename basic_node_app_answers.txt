module.exports is the object that gets returned from require, It can be reassigned. Exports can't be reassigned outside of a module. This is because it is a reference to module.exports.

Programming Questions
Before you begin, make sure you have greeting.js and main.js in the following states:

greeting.js
exports.greetingEnglish = function(){
 console.log("Hello");
}

exports.greetingJapanese = function(){
 console.log("Konichiwa");
}
main.js
const greetings = require("./greeting.js");

// "Hello"
greetings.greetingEnglish();

// "Konichiwa"
greetings.greetingJapanese();
Add two more functions, greetingSpanish and greetingIcelandic, in greeting.js.
Utilize the two functions in main.js just like greetingEnglish and greetingJapanese.
Create another Node module and import it into main.js. Your Node module should have at least two functions within it. Then, call a function from your Node module in main.js.
